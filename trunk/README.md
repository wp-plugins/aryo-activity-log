[WordPress ARYO Activity Log](http://wordpress.org/plugins/aryo-activity-log/)
===============

Get aware of the activities that are taking place on your dashboard! Weather a post was deleted or a plugin was activated, it’s all there for you to see.


We all know that it’s relatively easy to analyze what your visitors are looking for while browsing your site. But there is really no easy way to know what registered users (say, with an Administrator account or even Editors) are doing on the dashboard of your site. How can you know if a post was deleted? or if a plugin was activated/deactivated? or if the active theme was changed?
If you have tens of users or more, you really can’t know who did it. This plugin tries to solve this issue by tracking what users do on the dashboard of your WordPress site. 

__As of this moment, the plugin logs things when:__


Users
* A user logs in
* A user logs out
* A login has failed due to incorrect credentials
* A user updates their profile
* A new user account is being registered
* An existing user account is being deleted

Plugins
* A plugin is being activated
* A plugin is being deactivated
* A plugin is being changed

Themes
* A theme is being changed (Editor and Customizer)

Content
* A new post is being created
* A post is being updated
* A post changes status (draft, pending review, publish)
* A post is being deleted

Media

The plugin does not require any kind of setup. It works out of the box (and that’s why we love it too).

We’re planning to add a lot more features in the upcoming releases. If you think we’re missing something big time, please post your suggestions in the plugin’s forum.
