Get aware of any activities that are taking place on your dashboard! Imagine it like a black-box for your WordPress site.

== Description ==

<h3>Like being in control? Check this out.</h3>

We all know that it’s relatively easy to analyze what your visitors are looking for while browsing your site. But there is really no easy way to know what registered users (say, with an Administrator account or even Editors) are doing on the dashboard of your site. How can you know if a post was deleted? or if a plugin was activated/deactivated? or if the active theme was changed?
If you have tens of users or more, you really can’t know who did it. This plugin tries to solve this issue by tracking what users do on the dashboard of your WordPress site. 

<strong>As of this moment, the plugin logs things when:</strong><br />


Users

* A user logs in
* A user logs out
* A login has failed due to incorrect credentials
* A user updates their profile
* A new user account is being registerd
* An existing user account is being deleted

Plugins

* A plugin is being activated
* A plugin is being deactivated

Themes

* A theme is being changed

Content

* A new post is being created
* A post is being updated
* A post changes status (draft, pending review, publish)
* A post is being deleted

Media

* An attachment is being uploaded
* An attachment is being edited
* An attachment is being deleted

Widgets

* A widget is being added to a sidebar


The plugin does not require any kind of setup. It works out of the box (and that’s why we love it too).

We’re planning to add a lot more features in the upcoming releases. If you think we’re missing something big time, please post your suggestions in the plugin’s forum.
